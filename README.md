#Download Full List from NetAppU ILT Course Materials

The script source is from
<https://netapp.sharepoint.com/sites/NetAppU/CPD/ILT/Lists/ReleasedProducts1/Course%20and%20Kit.aspx>
It will download the whole list with all the properties. 

Replace your Domain_ID, domain_password and Path

The script will create a CSV file and an HTML file which contents are the same.

The HTML file uses the template.html to generate a full list page, the page uses JQuery and Sticky-table-headers. 
To make the table pretty, it also uses Bootstrap
Because the Stick-table-headers may not work on Safari, please use Chrome or Firefox to open it.
